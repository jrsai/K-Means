Collaborated with 3 fellow Software Engineering Students to implement K-Means using Lolyd's Algorithm which was also implemented along with a linked list as one of the data strucutres.   

<h1> Description </h1>
<p> K-Means helps plot dot and find clusters to help show a trend or pattern of the given data set.  </p>

<h1> What is does </h1>
<p> Takes a data 2-D data set as input along with the number of clusters wanted and computes the K-Means to give a scatter plot showing the clusters. </p>

<h1> Challenges </h1>
<p> Algorithm was difficult to implment as the equation to determine the K was confusing in the pseudocode. </p>

<h1> Future plans </h1>
<p>
<ul> <li>Make computations faster for bigger data sets </li> 
</ul> 
</p>
